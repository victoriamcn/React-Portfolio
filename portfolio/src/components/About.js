        <p class="">Hello there!</p>
        <p class="">I'm a full-stack web developer with a background in graphic design, allowing me to offer unique perspectives on user interaction with websites and software platforms. I recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the <a href="https://pe.gatech.edu/courses/georgia-tech-coding-boot-camp">Georgia Institute of Technology's Coding Certification program</a>. My strengths lie in creativity, teamwork, and debugging.</p>
        <p class="">In terms of technical skills, I have experience in:</p>
        <p class="">As a Project Analyst at Pike Engineering, I was also part of the exciting Mercury Vapor project with Duke Energy. Pike Lighting was chosen by Duke Energy in 2020 to upgrade all existing Mercury Vapor lights to LED lights by the end of 2023. 
            I played a pivotal role the initial set-up of the project: creating 661 individual work orders based on raw customer billing data across fourteen counties in South Carolina. 
            As the baton passed to the engineers to replace the lights, I managed the comprehensive reporting along the way. Despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and material shortages, my efforts and collaboration with my Pike and Duke managers enabled the Upstate Pike Lighting team stay ahead of schedule by several months. This experience strengthened my ability to adapt, overcome obstacles and deliver outstanding results in a fast-paced environment.</p>
        <p class="">I've worked on several exciting projects, including LaborHub, a wage-sharing app, NightOwl, an event and dining recommendation application, and the Weather Dashboard, a simple weather app. If you'd like to learn more about my experience, feel free to explore the links to my projects provided on this website.</p>
        <p class="">Beyond my professional life, I enjoy thrifting and upcycling furniture, appreciating art, architecture and interior design, and watching Wes Anderson movies. I'm also an avid traveler, having visited Peru, Belize, Italy, Ireland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, the Bahamas, Aruba, and various parts of Asia. Oh, and I can't forget to mention my lovely calico cat named Birdie Purtrude. Currently, I reside in South Carolina.</p>
        <p class="">I'm proud to be a recipient of the 2016 Awards For Student Work Gold Circle Award in Experimental Fiction for my piece titled "The Forgotten Case of the Phantom Lady" published in The Mountain Laurel Literary Magazine at North Greenville University.</p>
